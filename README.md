# HADAR
This is an LWIR stereo-hyperspectral database to develop HADAR algorithms for thermal navigation. Based on this database, one can develop algorithms for TeX decomposition to generate TeX vision. One can also develop algorithms about object detection, semantic or scene segmentation, optical or scene flow, stereo depth etc. based on TeX vision instead of traditional RGB or thermal vision.
